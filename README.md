# 💄 Sparkle Beauty Center Website

Welcome to the official repository for **Sparkle Beauty Center**, a web project built as part of the Web Programming final assignment at Al-Aqsa University.

#🌟 Project Overview

Sparkle Beauty Center is more than just a skincare hub—it’s a story of resilience and empowerment. After being destroyed during the aggression on Gaza, the center was rebuilt by an all-female team and now stands as one of the largest beauty and skincare centers in the city.

This website showcases the center’s services, creativity, and contact information, while offering a smooth and responsive user experience.

# 🎯 Target Audience

# ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

During development, I faced layout issues with image galleries and inconsistent input field sizes. I solved these by applying unified CSS styling and using Grid for responsive alignment. I also handled video autoplay limitations by adjusting volume settings and browser compatibility.
